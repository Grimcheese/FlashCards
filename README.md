FlashCards is a program designed to output to the user a series of prompts or questions and then the answer to that prompt or question when the user decides.

It has a GUI which allows for selection of topics which the user has input in a corresponding FlashCard file. 

Once the topic(s) have been selected the user will be prompted with a random question from that topic, they can then push a button and the screen will output the answer. The user can then carry on until all the prompts in that topic have been read, they can choose to redo the topic or choose another one.

Answer checking could be included and would take simple input (eg, one or two word answers, single numbers, match single words from a sentence).
